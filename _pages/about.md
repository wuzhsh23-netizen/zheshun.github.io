# Hi, I am Zheshun Wu 👋



I am currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Jie Liu (IEEE Fellow) and Prof. Zenglin Xu. Prior to this, I received my Master's degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Sun Yat-Sen University and Bachelor's degree in Information and Interaction Design from South China University of Technology in 2020.



My research interests lie broadly in **using machine learning theory to develop efficient, robust and generalizable algorithms for communication and networked systems**, with a particular focus on:

* **Efficient Training and Inference:** Distributed machine learning, Progressive training, Edge collaborative inference.

* **Online Learning and Reinforcement Learning:** Robust multi-armed bandits, Provably sample-efficient reinforcement learning. 

*  **Wireless Communications and Networking:** AI for communications, Wireless sensing and localization.
